  N64/DC/PSP

  - I consider these "BONUS". If any games play and you enjoy it, GREAT! Do not expect these systems to run smooth. Again... Bonus!

 ARCADE GAMES:

  - Arcade is set to use FBNEO to allow save states to function. MAME 2003 Plus is also included in the .ADD ONS folder. Save state is not supported in MAME.

PICO-8 GAMES:

  - Currently only fake08 is supported once available.

  - Unfortunately MainUI is causing issues to launch Pico-8 games using the png extension.
  
  Change the game to p8 extension by deleting .png from your cart file. I use ReNamer https://www.den4b.com/products/renamer

      Example:
        Tomb of G'Nir.p8.png
        to
        Tomb of G'Nir.p8



**BIOS**

  Place your BIOS files in the BIOS folder located in RetroArch/.retroarch



**RETROARCH**

  Do not adjust settings in retroarch unless you are familiar with it.
  Removing or changing settings may cause games or controls to not work correctly.



**THEMES**

  Included are 3 themes located in Settings. I plan on adding more icons and themes in the future.
  You can add themes from your Miyoo Mini or MMP. NOTE that there will be missing assets as the a30 has additional ones.
